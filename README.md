# [Defi Developer Journal]

Hello, My name is Mikal Muhammad, I'm an audio engineer and owner of Twenty Seven Sounds Inc. I was first bitten by the crypto bug way back in 2009, although interested I focused on my passion for sound. It was actually while studying small electric circuits and DSP that really pushed me back into the crypto space. I did everything I could to immerse myself within this environment, using many wallets, purchasing and selling coins, giving as many protocols a try as possible. Then there was only one thing left to do... build and I would like to keep a journal of my experience here. Thank you for reading Happy Hacking!
